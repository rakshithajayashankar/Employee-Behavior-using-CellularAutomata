<h2> Employee Behavior Using 2D Cellular Automata  </h2>

<h4>To model employee behavior using a 2D cellular automata, we represent each employee as a cell in a 2D grid. The state of each cell corresponds to the motivation level of the corresponding employee, which can be quantified on a scale ranging from low to high.</h4>
